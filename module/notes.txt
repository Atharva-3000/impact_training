In python programming, we have 2 types of modules:
1. normal import
2. from import
from filename import function or *

Using the modules concept, we can access the properties of one python file inside another python file.

In real time scenario, one application of programs, so 2 programs will communicate with each other using modules concept(sending and receiving the valuess)
