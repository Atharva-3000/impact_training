# Knapsack Problem

1. It is an example of combinational optimization problem. 

2. It is also known as Ruk-sack problem.

3. The name if the problem is defined from the maximization problem, i.e. given a bag, with maximum weight capacity of w, and set of items, each having a weight and value associated with it.

4. Decide the number of each item to take in a collection such that total weight is less than capacity and the total value is maximized.

## Types of Knapsack problem:

1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem: 
    1. We are given n itmes, where each item has some weight(wi) and value (vi) .
    2. We are also given a back with capacity w, the target is to put the items into the bag such that, the sum of values associated with them is maximum.
    3. We can either put the item wholly or cannot put it at all.


3. Bounded Knapsack Problem
4. Unbounded Knapsack Problem.
