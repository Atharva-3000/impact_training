# Hash Set

1. Hash Set is a collection of objects. i.e. data is stored as objects.

2. It internally uses hash table data structutre to store the data items.

3. Just like a set, hash set also, doesn't allow storage of duplicate elements.

# Hash Map and Hash Table

1. They are the same, i.e. the way of storing and organising the information is same.

2. They are implemented by `dictionary` in python.

3. Hash Function will establish the relation between keys and values.

## Hash Function

It is a function that accepts a string and returns a number.

### Hashing

1. It is a technique which is used in computer science to efficiently store and retrieve the data.

2. It envolves converting data into fixed size values called **hash codes**.

3. These hash codes are used as indexes to store the data in data structures. Like `hash maps`, `hash tables` and `hash sets`
