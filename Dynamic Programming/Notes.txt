Most of the problems can be solved in multiple ways:

1. Using iterative approach: using loops
2. Using recursive method
3. Using Tabular method and memoization: Comes under dynamic programming

    1. The first 2 approaches will consume more time and memory, i.e. complexity will be more.
    2. Optimization can be achieved through dynamic programming i.e. memory and time    optimization.
    3. Dynamic programming will take more time as compared to greedy algorithm, but it  will take less time as compared to general approaches.(loops and recursion)

#Using iterative method:
1. Implementaion of fibonacci series using iterative method.

#Finding the nth term using tabular method
1. In this approach we are going to store the result in memory.
2. We are going to calculate the value only once, if next time same value is required, then we are going to access from the memory.
By this approach, we can consume less time, that is time complexity is less.
