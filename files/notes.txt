We can perform different operations on the file such as 

open
read
write
we can append the data into the file and 
finally we can close the file.

different modes available in the file are:
r mode: indicates the read operation
w mode: indicates the write operation
a mode: indicates the append operation
r+ mode: indicates read and write operations at a time
