Python has 2 types of variables

Global and Local


Local variables:
Local variables can be accessed within the function:
Once the execution of the fucntion is completed it will be destroyed.

Global variables:
The variables which are declared at the top of the program are called as global variables.
We can access global varriables anywhere within the program


A function prioritizes the local variables in the function over the global variables
