1. It is a subprogram and it performs a specific operation
2. A self contained block of one or more statements is called as a function

======>Advantages

    a. Reusability: Writing the code only once, but we can use more than once
    b. Understanding the logic becomes easy
    c. In python programming we can define a function using the "def" keyword

    d. Functions are divided into 4 types:
        i.  Function without args and without return type
        ii. Function with args and without return type
        iii.Function with args and with return type: In this approach we will pass the args from main to subprogram and sub will return the value back to the main function
        iv. Function without args and with return type (not used mostly)
