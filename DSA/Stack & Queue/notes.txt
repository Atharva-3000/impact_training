STACK:
It follows LIFO
Operations are:
1.Push: Using this, we can insert the element into the stack.
2.Pop:  Using the pop operation, we can delete the top most element of the stack.
3.Display: Displays the data

It can be implemented in three ways:
1. Using List
2. Using LinkedList
3. Using Deque class



QUEUE:
It follows FIFO.
Operations are:
1. enqueue: insertion
2. dequeue: deletes the element from the queue

Queue can be implemented in three ways:
1. Using List
2. Using Dequeue class
3. Using LinkedList
