STACK:
It follows LIFO
Operations are:
1.Push: Using this, we can insert the element into the stack.
2.Pop:  Using the pop operation, we can delete the top most element of the stack.
3.Display: Displays the data

It can be implemented in three ways:
1. Using List
2. Using LinkedList
3. Using Deque class



QUEUE:
It follows FIFO.
Operations are:
1. enqueue: insertion
2. dequeue: deletes the element from the queue

Queue can be implemented in three ways:
1. Using List
2. Using Dequeue class
3. Using LinkedList

PRIORITY QUEUE
1. Priority queue is similar to queue, but has priority.
2. In priority queue we can assign priority, then according to the priority, elements get deleted.
3. The different ways of assigning priorities are:
    a. Ascending order
    b. Descending order
