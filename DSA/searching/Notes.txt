SEARCHING TECHNIQUES IN PYTHON

Python supports two types of SEARCHING
1. linear Search: We compare each element present in the list. If the element is found, then it will store the index, if not found, will return -1
We will compare each and every element with the key, this algo will take more time meaning more time complexity.
O(n)

2. Binary Search
i.  In binary search, first we have to sort the elements\
ii. Calculate low and high valuestha is low=0, high=len(l)-1 and Calculate mid as mid=low+(high-low)//2
Based on the mid position, find out middle value in the list then compare middle value with the key value, if mid<key set low=mid+1 else set high=mid-1
O(logn)
If both the two conditions are not satisfied, that will be indicated as middle value and key value both are equal return index, if not found return -1.
