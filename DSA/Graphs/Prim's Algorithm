### Graph should be weighted, connected and undirected.

1. Consider any vertex.

2. Find all edges from the selected vertex to all vertices. Select least weighted edge and include it in the tree, if least weighted edge forms a circle, then discard it and consider next least weighted edge and include it in the minimum spanning tree.

3. Perform step 2 until all vertices are included in the tree.
