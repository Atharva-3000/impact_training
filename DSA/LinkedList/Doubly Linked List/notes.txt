DOUBLY LINKED LIST:

It is a collection of nodes.

Every node will be connected to the next node.

In doubly linked list, every node will contain 3 fields:
1. prev (previous node address)
2. data
3. next (next node address)

For the first node, prev field address will be None.
For the last node, next field address will be None.

The basic operations we can perform on the double linked list are:
1. Creating the nodes
2. Inserting the data into the nodes
3. Display the data present in the nodes
4. Reversing the data present in the nodes through the tail.
5. Adding the nodes
6. Deleting the nodes
