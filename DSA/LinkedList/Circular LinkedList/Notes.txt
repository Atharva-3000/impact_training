CIRCULAR LINKEDLIST:

It is similar to single linked list but Address of the last node will be connected to first node, that's why last node address is address of the first node.
Contains only head, but circular LINKEDLIST contains head and tail

Head always points to first node.
Tail always pointing to last node.
