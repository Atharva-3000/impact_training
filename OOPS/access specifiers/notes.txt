In python,  we have three different access modifiers:
1. Private
2. Public
3. Protected

1. PUBLIC:
If variable or method is public, we can access anywhere within the program.

2. PROTECTED:
If variable or method is protected, we can access within the next immediate class(Can't access in the main program).

Protected variables can be declared using "_"

3. PRIVATE:
If a variable or method is private, we can access within the same class.
in python programming, we can declare private variables and methods using '__'
