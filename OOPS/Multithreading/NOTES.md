# Multithreading Notes

This repository contains notes on multithreading in Python.

## Overview

Multithreading allows for the execution of multiple threads simultaneously, enabling concurrent execution of different parts of a program. Threads are lightweight processes that run within a program's process.

## About Multithreading

1. Functionality or logic that executes simultaneously with other parts of the program.
2. Defining functionality and logic as a thread by overriding the `run` method of the `thread` class.
3. The `thread` class, a pre-defined class in the threading model.
4. Executing threads using the `start` method of the `thread` class.
5. Additional information on multithreading.
