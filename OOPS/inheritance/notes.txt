Inheritance is classified into six types:

1. Single inheritance:
The concept of inheriting properties from only one class into another class is known as "single inheritance.


2. Multi-level inheritance
The concept of inheriting properties from multiple classes into one class with the concept of "one after another" is known as "multi-level inheritance".


3. Hierarchical inheritance
The concept of inheriting properties from one class into multiple classes seperately is known as "hierarchical inheritance".


4. Multiple inheritance
The concept of inheriting properties from multiple classes into single class at a time is known as "multiple inheritance".


5. Cyclic inheritance
The concept of inheriting properties from subclass to superclass is known as "cyclic inheritance".
Python doesnt support cyclic inheritance


6. Hybrid inheritance
The combination of all types of inheritance is known as "hybrid inheritance".


OBJECT CLASS:
Object class is a pre-defined class which is defined in built-in models.
Object is a superclass for every class in Python.
Object class properties can bea ccessed in every class directly and we can also access through every class reference variable
